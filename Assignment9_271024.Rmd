## Retrieving Data from the New York Times Books API

In this analysis, data was retrieved from the [New York Times Books API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/books-product/1/routes/lists/overview.json/get), which provides access to top 5 books for all the Best Sellers lists for specified date and related metadata. The API allows users to fetch information about books, lists, and rankings.

```{r setup}
# Load necessary libraries
library(jsonlite)   # For JSON processing
library("dplyr")
library(knitr)

# Load the JSON file
books_json <- fromJSON("C:/Users/ninan/iCloudDrive/Study/CUNY/607 Data Acquisition and Management/w9/best_selling_books.json")

# Extract the list ids from the results
category_list <- books_json$results$lists

# Selected list Data frame 
selected_lists_df <- category_list %>%
  select(list_id, list_name)

kable((selected_lists_df), caption = "Books categories") 

# Extract the books list from the results
books_list <- books_json$results$lists$books

# Accessing the first book data frame in the list
books_df1 <- books_list[[1]]

# Selected first book Data frame 
selected_books_df1 <- books_df1 %>%
  select(author, title)

kable((selected_books_df1), caption = "5 best selling books for Combined Print and E-Book Fiction") # First data frame

# Combining all data frames into one
all_books_df <- bind_rows(books_list)

# Selected combined Data frame 
selected_all_books_df <- all_books_df %>%
  select(author, title)

# Display the combined data frame
kable((selected_all_books_df), caption = "5 best selling books for different categories_2013-01-01")
